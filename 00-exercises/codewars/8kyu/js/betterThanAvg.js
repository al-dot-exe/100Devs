// There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!

// You receive an array with your peers' test scores. 
// Now calculate the average and compare your score!
//
// Return True if you're better, else False!
// Note:
//
// Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. 
// For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!
